## Topics: Big O and Hashtables

* **Big O Notation**: Describing an algorithm's complexity
* **Hashtables**: Stores data with key value pairs

What you will submit:
- A GitHub repo with this README file (with the boxes checked).
- Create a GIF showing your Interviewbit dashboard (see below) showing exercises you've done.

### Required tasks

**Big O Notation**

- [x] Watch [Big O Notation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4cd1O4zkGw)(8m)
  - I have learned about what Big O is. It is how time scales with respect to input variables
  - there are 4 rules when calculate complexity of algorithm
	* different step get added
	* drop constant, 0(2n) => 0(n)
	* different inputs => different variables
	* Drop non-dominate term
- [x] Read [Big O Notation in plain English](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/487258/what-is-a-plain-english-explanation-of-big-o-notation) and write down what you learned from it
  - I have learned that important term. These are “Relative”, “Representation”, “Complexity”
  - understand the way to find name in telephone book. It is called a binary search.

- [x] Visit http://bigocheatsheet.com/ and think about how useful it could be to you
  - This sheet makes more sense to me now. Thought I just know little about data structure and sorting algorithms. From that sheet, I know binary search is effective way for access/search/insertion/deletion because it have light screen (good) for all cases. Same thought, I see best sort algorithm is radix sort. So in that sheet, I don’t understand what Ω(n+k) mean

- [x] Watch LogN in 5m: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjDR1NBB9MU
  - I have learned that how binary search/binary search tree/ quick sort do. How to calculate complexity of these algorithms
  - binary search/ binary search tree: O(logN)
  - quick sort O(N*logN)

**Hashtables**

- [x] Read [InterviewCake Hashtable](https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/java/hash-map?)
	I have learned that what a hash table is. A hash table (also called a hash, hash map, map, unordered map or dictionary) is a data structure that pairs keys to values.
	Hash tables:
		take on average O(1)O(1) time for insertions and lookups
		are unordered (the keys are not guaranteed to stay in the same order)
		can use many types of objects as keys
- [x] Watch concept video: [HackerRank Video: Hash Tables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shs0KM3wKv8) (6m)

Extras:
- [x] [Introducing Hash Tables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfhjkfocRR0) (7m)
- [x] [Hash Table Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke_tII6Y0GE) (7m)
	I have understand what Hash function, Hash tables, Collision
	+ Hash function generates index from key
	+ Hash tables content pair key and index
	+ Collision happens when a many of key reference to one index

**Coding**

- [x] Set up an account on Interviewbit.com and start the [Programming course](htts://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/)
- [x] Finish at least 2 tasks on Exercism

### Optional tasks

Some tasks are the same as optional tasks in Assignment 1.

- [ ] Do more tasks on exercism
- [ ] Finish [Time Complexity chapter](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/time-complexity) in Level 1 of Interviewbit
- [ ] Finish [Arrays chapter]((https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/arrays/)) in Level 2 of Interviewbit
- [ ] Finish [Math chapter](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/math/) in Level 2 of Interviewbit.
